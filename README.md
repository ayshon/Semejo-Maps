# Semejo-Maps
ECE297 Geographic Information System (GIS) Project

The code is private to avoid academic offenses.

The project was divided into 4 milestones:

## Milestone 1
Extracted city information such as streets, intersections, buildings, parks, and other geographic features from the OpenStreetMap database and loaded them into data structures. Wrote functions to answer simple queries.  

## Milestone 2
Drew the map to visualize the city features. Edited UI to allow for users to interact with the map, these iteractions included panning, zooming and searching for streets and intersections.

## Milestone 3
Wrote algorithms to find travel routes between between intersectoions. We initially used the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm but then implemented an A* greedy algorithm to achieve faster run times. 

## Milestone 4
Wrote algorithms to find a travel route for many courier deliveries to minimize travel time.
